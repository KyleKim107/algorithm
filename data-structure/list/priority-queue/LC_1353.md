* Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]
* Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi
* can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei (you can only attend one event at any time d)
* Return the maximum number of events you can attend

```txt
Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

    heapq.heappop(h) # greedily attend the event that ends soonest
