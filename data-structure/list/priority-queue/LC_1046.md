> Question

* Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones with x, y (x <= y) and smash them together, then
  * If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
  * If x != y, stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x
* At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone
