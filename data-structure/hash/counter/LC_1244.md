> Question

* Design a Leaderboard class, which has 3 functions:
  * addScore(playerId, score): Update the leaderboard by adding score to the given player's score
    * If there is no player with such id in the leaderboard, add him to the leaderboard with the given score.
  * top(K): Return the score sum of the top K players.
  * reset(playerId): Reset the score of the player with the given id to 0 (in other words erase it from the leaderboard)
    * It is guaranteed that the player was added to the leaderboard before calling this function.
