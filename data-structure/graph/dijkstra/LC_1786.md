> Question

* Given an undirected weighted connected graph
* with a positive integer n which denotes that graph has n nodes labeled from 1 to n, and edges= [ui, vi, weighti]
* A path from node start to node end is a sequence of nodes [z0, z1, z2, ..., zk] such that z0 = start and zk = end
* there is an edge between zi and zi+1 where 0 <= i <= k-1
* The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path
* Let distanceToLastNode(x) denote the shortest distance of a path between node n and node x
* Restricted path is a path that also satisfies that distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1) where 0 <= i <= k-1
* Return # restricted paths from node 1 to node n modulo 10 ** 9 + 7
