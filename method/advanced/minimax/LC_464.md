> Question

* In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10
* The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins
* What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
* [ex] two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement
  until they reach a total >= 100
* Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return if the first player to move can force a win
* Assume both players play optimally

```txt
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
```

```py
  bool canIWin(int M, int T) {
    int sum = M*(M+1)/2; // sum of entire choosable pool
    if (T < 2) return true; // I just pick 1 to win

    // Total is too large, nobody can win
    else if (sum < T) return false;

    // Total happens to match sum, whoever picks at odd times wins
    else if (sum == T) return M%2;

    // Non-trivial case: do DFS
    // Initial total: T
    // Initial game state: k = 0 (all numbers are not picked)
    else return dfs(M, T, 0);
  }

  // DFS to check if I can win
  // k: current game state
  // T: remaining total to reach
  bool dfs(int M, int T, int k)
  {
    if (mem[k] != 0) return mem[k] > 0; // memorized

    // total is already reached by opponent, so I lose
    if (T <= 0) return false;

    // try all currently available numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i)
      // if (i+1) is available to pick and my opponent can't win after I picked, I win!
      if (!(k&(1<<i)) && !dfs(M, T-i-1, k|(1<<i))) {
        mem[k] = 1;
        return true;
      }

    mem[k] = -1; // Otherwise, I will lose
    return false;
  }

  // m[key]: memorized game result when pool state = key
  // 0: un-computed; 1: I win; -1: I lose
  int mem[1<<20] = {};
