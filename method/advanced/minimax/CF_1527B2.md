  * Choose any 𝑖 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛), where 𝑠[𝑖]= '0' and change 𝑠[𝑖] to '1'. Pay 1 dollar
  * Reverse the whole string, pay 0 dollars
    * only allowed if the string is not a palindrome, and the last operation was not reverse
* game ends when every character of string becomes '1'
* The player who spends minimum dollars till this point wins the game and it is a draw if both spend equal dollars
