* n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more than one, do the following:
  * Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row
  * Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score
  * Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row
* The game stops when only one stone is left in the row
* Given Alice starting, find score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally
