> Question

* Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task
* Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle
* However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks
* Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks

```txt
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
```
