> Question

* There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]
* Empty gas car starts from any of gas station and it costs cost[i] to travel from ith station to its next (i + 1)th station
* Given two arrays gas and cost, return starting gas station's index that can travel around once in the clockwise direction
  * otherwise return -1. Solution is unique

```txt
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
```
