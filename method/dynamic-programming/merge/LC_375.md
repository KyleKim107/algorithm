> Question

* We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:
  * I pick a number between 1 and n
  * You guess a number
  * If you guess the right number, you win the game
  * If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether picked number is higher or lower, and will continue guessing
  * Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game
