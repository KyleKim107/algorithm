> Questions

* Given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone
* On each turn, choose any two stones with x, y (x <= y) and smash them together
  * If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
  * If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x
* Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone at the end. if no stones left, 0

> Solution

* w[i] = stones[i] (Weight of jewel)
* v[i] = stones[i] (Value of jewel)
* W = sum(stones) / 2 (Capacity of bag)
