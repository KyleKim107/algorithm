> Question

* Given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length
* A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string and swap the characters at these indices
* is it possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings

```txt
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
```

def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
  diff = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(s1, s2) if x != y]
  return not diff or len(diff) == 2 and diff[0][::-1] == diff[1]
```
